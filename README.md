A minecraft plugin for the servers I used to run. Source isn't really cleaned up, the project is just sort of where I left off. 
The code isn't perfect, feel free to open issues and I might maybe fix them. If you fix anything, feel free to make pull request. 

I can't ''''''legally'''''' provide the dependencies, which I would normally just keep a few jars for people. 
It's dumb, whatever. Just run the build jar from Spigot's site and setup the dependencies to build yourself. 

If you make something neat, shoot me message so I can check it out.
