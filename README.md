# cotycraft
A minecraft plugin for the servers I used to run. Source isn't really cleaned up, the project is just sort of where I left off. 
The code isn't perfect, feel free to open issues and I might maybe fix them. If you fix anything, I'll probably accept your pull request
unless your code is somehow exceptionally bad. 

I can't ''''''legally'''''' provide the dependencies, which I would normally just keep a few jars for people. 
It's dumb, whatever. Just run the build jar from Spigit's site and setup the dependencies to build yourself. 

The license is a big "I don't care" of text. Do whatever you want with the project. If it's something neat, I'd appreciate a heads up so I could
check it out or something. Good luck.
